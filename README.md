# 🧠 Symbolic World Generator (SWG-RL)

Welcome to the official repository of **Symbolic World Generator with Reinforcement Learning (SWG-RL)** — a domain-level symbolic planner powered by large language models and trajectory-based feedback.

## 🚀 Model Release

We are excited to announce that the **SWG-RL trained model** is now **open-sourced** on Hugging Face!
